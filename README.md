A quick and dirty multi-threading python script that uses [pytube](https://pytube.io/en/latest/) and the [WaybackMachineSaveAPI](https://github.com/akamhy/waybackpy) to simultaneously download all of the videos from a given youtube channel to your computer AND archive them in the Way Back Internet Archive.

Used to back up [Spleeber's](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9K82e-1zNzYKRuZM0uheWA) videos in case his channel is ever taken down.
